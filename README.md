Hatter rounded gnome icons
======

Hatter is a rounded square icon theme for linux desktops. The goal is to integrate well with the default Gnome desktop asthetics with rounded windows and buttons. The design philosophy is to create a rouded square theme that is faithfull to the application's identity, name and branding.

## Version 2.0 is radical different from the prevous versions of Hatter.

-Foremost, this is not a fork from Whitesur anymore.
-The directory structure is now based on the directory structure of Adwaita, the default Gnome icon theme, instead of Whitesur.
-Hatter-yaru is now a color variant instead of a full icon theme.
-the symbolic icons are now inherited from Adwaita instead of Whitesur, This choice was made for different reasons.
  
  1) It is much easier to maintain, so i can focus more time on the creation of App icons.
  2) The chance of Gnome updates breaking things is reduced significant.
  3) It stays consistent when missing icons are inherited from Adwaita.
  4) The old symbolic icons, tend to be less readable for some users.

-A full redesign of the folders
